      "As of today's close, the NIFTY NEXT 50 index presents a mixed picture. Technically, Nifty has been consolidating within a 24,650â€“25,050 range, indicating a consolidation phase amidst high volatility. Despite this, it has defended key support zones and remains above its 20-day EMA, suggesting a broader bullish undertone. The daily RSI has tilted downward, while the MACD (20) is 52.48 and the ADX (14) is 11.49.\n",

      "Options data reveals heavy build-up in 25,000 and 25,500 Calls, marking stiff resistance zones. The 24,500 Put holds the highest open interest, with 24,000 as a secondary support. A move above 25,000 could trigger a short-covering rally towards 25,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "The market is likely to consolidate around current levels. While the long-term structural growth drivers remain intact, focus should be on specific themes and stock-level opportunities, with caution due to recent breakouts lacking follow-up buying. As long as Nifty remains above the critical 24,500 zone and key moving averages, bulls remain in charge, but a breakout beyond the 24,650-25,050 range is needed to unlock momentum.\n"
